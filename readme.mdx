# Getting Started

Welcome to Coderz!

<Alert>

## Requirements

**Software**: macOS, Linux (currently supports Debian 9 and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS), or any host with Docker

Note: Windows is not officially supported at this time. However, community members succeeded in setting up nodes using Windows Subsystem for Linux.

**Hardware**: Sending and receiving does not require any special hardware, but running a block producer currently requires:

- at least a 8-core processor
- at least 16GB of RAM

Note that if you plan on running a snark worker node at the same time as a block producer, you may need more RAM. GPUs aren't currently required, but may be required for node operators when the protoctol is upgraded.

**Network**: At least 1 Mbps connection
